# Facial_Autoencoder
Unsupervised learning with the Yale Faces dataset. A convolutional autoencoder that attempts to reconstruct faces.  
Please note that FaceDraw.py does not serve any practical purpose. It just feeds user draw images in to the CNN.  
# Test Example
On the left is an image that has a majority of its shading removed. On the right is an attempt of the CNN to recreate this image.

This model could be improved with better feature extraction. Maybe with a model that analyzes the facial structure of a face.
